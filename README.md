## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Docker installed on your system (see Lesson 02)
   - Basic command-line knowledge
   - Text editor for code examples
   - AWS Account (for Lesson 13 - ECR)

2. **How to Use This Course**
   - Each lesson is in its own folder
   - Read the README.md in each lesson folder
   - Follow along with commands step-by-step
   - All commands are in the README (no separate scripts)
   - Run commands one by one to see output
   - Containers run in foreground so you can see logs

3. **Practice Approach**
   - Don't just read - run the commands!
   - See logs in real-time (containers run in foreground)
   - Open another terminal if you need to run additional commands
   - Modify examples to understand better
   - Try breaking things and fixing them
   - Build your own projects
